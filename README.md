# Foodie

The curated corporate internet has become the equivalent of a cluster of Fast Food chains.  Shoveling the cheapest shit possible into your head and only focused on their own profit margins.  There was a point in time where people would talk about the internet as a source of value, something that could nurture you intellectually, a place of possibility and discovery.

Recapture that feeling!

Foodie aims to help you curate your own "internet".  No it won't necessarily help you find new sources.  But when you do find a source that you find has "nutritional" value or a fantastic flavor it will help you stay fed.

## WTF?

Not one for garbage statements and other whimsical crap?  Foodie is basically designed to be a feed aggregator.  A tool you can use to keep yourself updated on information that **you** find valuable, and at your own pace.
